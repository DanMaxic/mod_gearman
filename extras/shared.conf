# Possible values are:
#     0 = only errors
#     1 = debug messages
#     2 = trace messages
#     3 = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.
# Default is 0.

# Possible values are:
#     automatic
#          -> logfile when a logfile is specified
#          -> stdout for tools
#     file
#          -> use logfile
#     stdout
#           -> just print all messages to stdout
#     core
#           -> use nagios internal loging (not thread safe! Use with care)

# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care about
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to
# use hostgroups for easy configuration of your services.
# If set to yes, you still have to define which hostchecks should be
# processed by either using 'hosts' or the 'hostgroups' option.
# Default is Yes.

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.

# result queue is not processed fast enough.
# Default: 1

# defines if the module should distribute perfdata
# to gearman.
# Note: processing of perfdata is not part of

# Minimum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time.
min-worker=1

# Maximum number of worker processes which should

# min-worker setting to disable dynamic starting of
# workers. When setting this to 1, all services from
# this worker will be executed one after another.

spawn-rate=1


# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
workaround_rc_25=off
