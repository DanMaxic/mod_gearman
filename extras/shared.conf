# use debug to increase the verbosity of the module.
# Possible values are:
#     0   = only errors
#     1-4 = debug verbosity
#     5   = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.
# Default is 0.

# set the way of logging
# Possible values are:
#     automatic
#          -> logfile when a logfile is specified
#          -> stdout for tools
#     file
#          -> use logfile
#     stdout
#           -> just print all messages to stdout
#     core
#           -> use nagios internal loging (not thread safe! Use with care)

# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care about
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to
# use hostgroups for easy configuration of your services.
# If set to yes, you still have to define which hostchecks should be
# processed by either using 'hosts' or the 'hostgroups' option.
# Default is Yes.

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.
# Encryption is enabled by default and you have to
# explicitly disable it.
# When using encryption, you will either have to
# specify a shared password with key=... or a
# keyfile with keyfile=...
# Default is On.
encryption=yes


# A shared password which will be used for
# encryption of data pakets. Should be at least 8
# bytes long. Maximum length is 32 characters.

###############################################################################

# sets a list of hostgroups which will not be executed
# by gearman. They are just passed through.
# Default: none
localhostgroups=


# sets a list of servicegroups which will not be executed
# by gearman. They are just passed through.
# Default: none
localservicegroups=


# Number of result worker threads. Usually one is
# enough. You may increase the value if your
# result queue is not processed fast enough.
# Default: 1
result_workers=1


# defines if the module should distribute perfdata
# to gearman.
# Note: processing of perfdata is not part of
# mod_gearman. You will need additional worker for
# handling performance data. For example: pnp4nagios
# Performance data is just written to the gearman
# queue.
# Default: no
perfdata=no

# perfdata mode overwrite helps preventing the perdata queue getting to big
# 1 = overwrote
# 2 = append
perfdata_mode=1

# The Mod-Gearman NEB module will submit a fake result for orphaned host
# checks with a message saying there is no worker running for this
# queue. Use this option to get better reporting results, otherwise your
# hosts will keep their last state as long as there is no worker
# running.
# Default: yes
orphan_host_checks=yes

# Same like 'orphan_host_checks' but for services.
# Default: yes
orphan_service_checks=yes

# Worker Config
#
# the following settings are for the worker only and

###############################################################################

# Identifier, hostname will be used if undefined
#identifier=hostname

# Path to the pidfile.
pidfile=./worker.pid

# Path to the logfile.
logfile=./worker.log

# Default job timeout in seconds. Currently this value is only used for
# eventhandler. The worker will use the values from the core for host and
# service checks.
job_timeout=60

# Minimum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time.
min-worker=1

# Maximum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time. You may set this equal to
# min-worker setting to disable dynamic starting of
# workers. When setting this to 1, all services from
# this worker will be executed one after another.
max-worker=20

# idling worker will terminate after this amount of seconds
# until min-worker is reached
idle-timeout=30

# worker will terminate after this amount of jobs done
max-jobs=50

# defined the rate of spawed worker per second as long
# as there are jobs waiting
spawn-rate=1

# Use this option to disable an extra fork for each plugin execution. Disabling
# this option will reduce the load on the worker host but can lead to problems with
# unclean plugin. Default: no
fork_on_exec=no

# Use this option to show stderr output of plugins too.
# Default: yes
show_error_output=yes

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this
# switch to enable or disable the embedded perl interpreter.
enable_embedded_perl=on

# Default value used when the perl script does not have a
# "nagios: +epn" or "nagios: -epn" set.
# Perl scripts not written for epn support usually fail with epn,
# so its better to set the default to off.
use_embedded_perl_implicitly=off

# Cache compiled perl scripts. This makes the worker process a little
# bit bigger but makes exection of perl scripts even faster.
# When turned off, Mod-Gearman will still use the embedded perl
# interpreter, but will not cache the compiled script.
use_perl_cache=on

# path to p1 file which is used to execute and cache the
# perl scripts run by the embedded perl interpreter
p1_file=./worker/mod_gearman_p1.pl

# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
workaround_rc_25=off
