# use debug to increase the verbosity of the module.
# Possible values are:
#     0   = only errors
#     1-4 = debug verbosity
#     5   = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.
# Default is 0.
debug=0


# set the way of logging
# Possible values are:
#     automatic
#          -> logfile when a logfile is specified
#          -> stdout for tools
#     file
#          -> use logfile
#     stdout
#           -> just print all messages to stdout
#     syslog
#           -> use syslog for all log events

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly

# Minimum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time.
min-worker=1

# Maximum number of worker processes which should

# timeout_return defines the return code for timed out checks. Accepted return
# codes are 0 (Ok), 1 (Warning), 2 (Critical) and 3 (Unknown) Default: 2

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this

# Default value used when the perl script does not have a
# "nagios: +epn" or "nagios: -epn" set.
# Perl scripts not written for epn support usually fail with epn,
# so its better to set the default to off.
use_embedded_perl_implicitly=off

# Cache compiled perl scripts. This makes the worker process a little
# bit bigger but makes exection of perl scripts even faster.
# When turned off, Mod-Gearman will still use the embedded perl
# interpreter, but will not cache the compiled script.

# restrict_path allows you to restrict this worker to only execute plugins
# from these particular folders. Can be used multiple times to specify more
# than one folder.

# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
