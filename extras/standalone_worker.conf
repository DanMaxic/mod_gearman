# use debug to increase the verbosity of the module.
# Possible values are:
#     0   = only errors
#     1-4 = debug verbosity
#     5   = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.
# Default is 0.

# Possible values are:
#     automatic
#          -> logfile when a logfile is specified
#          -> stdout for tools
#     file
#          -> use logfile
#     stdout
#           -> just print all messages to stdout
#     syslog
#           -> use syslog for all log events

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.
# Encryption is enabled by default and you have to

# When using encryption, you will either have to

# keyfile with keyfile=...
# Default is On.
encryption=yes


# A shared password which will be used for
# encryption of data pakets. Should be at least 8
# bytes long. Maximum length is 32 characters.

# Maximum number of worker processes which should

# min-worker setting to disable dynamic starting of
# workers. When setting this to 1, all services from
# this worker will be executed one after another.

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this
# switch to enable or disable the embedded perl interpreter.
enable_embedded_perl=on

# Default value used when the perl script does not have a
# "nagios: +epn" or "nagios: -epn" set.
# Perl scripts not written for epn support usually fail with epn,
# so its better to set the default to off.

# Cache compiled perl scripts. This makes the worker process a little
# bit bigger but makes exection of perl scripts even faster.
# When turned off, Mod-Gearman will still use the embedded perl
# interpreter, but will not cache the compiled script.

# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
