#     3 = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.

# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care about
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to
# use hostgroups for easy configuration of your services.
# If set to yes, you still have to define which hostchecks should be
# processed by either using 'hosts' or the 'hostgroups' option.
# Default is Yes.

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.

# Default is On.

# Path to the pidfile. Usually set by the init script
#pidfile=%PIDFILE%

# Default job timeout in seconds. Currently this value is only used for
# eventhandler. The worker will use the values from the core for host and
# service checks.
job_timeout=60

# Minimum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time.
min-worker=5

# Maximum number of worker processes which should
# run at any time. You may set this equal to
# min-worker setting to disable dynamic starting of
# workers. When setting this to 1, all services from
# this worker will be executed one after another.
max-worker=50

# Time after which an idling worker exists
# This parameter controls how fast your waiting workers will
# exit if there are no jobs waiting.
idle-timeout=30

# Controls the amount of jobs a worker will do before he exits
# Use this to control how fast the amount of workers will go down
# after high load times
max-jobs=1000

# max-age is the threshold for discarding too old jobs. When a new job is older
# than this amount of seconds it will not be executed and just discarded. Set to
# zero to disable this check.
#max-age=0

# defines the rate of spawned worker per second as long
# as there are jobs waiting
spawn-rate=1

# Use this option to disable an extra fork for each plugin execution. Disabling
# this option will reduce the load on the worker host but can lead to problems with
# unclean plugin. Default: yes
fork_on_exec=no

# Use this option to show stderr output of plugins too.
# Default: yes
show_error_output=yes

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this
# switch to enable or disable the embedded perl interpreter.
enable_embedded_perl=on

# Default value used when the perl script does not have a
# "nagios: +epn" or "nagios: -epn" set.
# Perl scripts not written for epn support usually fail with epn,
# so its better to set the default to off.
use_embedded_perl_implicitly=off

# Cache compiled perl scripts. This makes the worker process a little
# bit bigger but makes execution of perl scripts even faster.
# When turned off, Mod-Gearman will still use the embedded perl
# interpreter, but will not cache the compiled script.
use_perl_cache=on

# path to p1 file which is used to execute and cache the
# perl scripts run by the embedded perl interpreter
p1_file=%P1FILE%


# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
workaround_rc_25=off
