Contributed Addons
==================

This folder contains unsorted addons for Mod-Gearman.


gearman_proxy.pl
----------------

Proxy Gearman Jobs from one jobserver to another jobserver. This could
be handy, when you have a worker in a remote net and only push is
allowed.

Mod-Gearman <-> Gearmand <-> Gearman-Proxy <--|--> Gearmand <-> Worker

Instead of the Worker polling from the master gearmand, it can now
poll the jobs from a local jobserver which gets fed by the
Gearman-Proxy.

send_gearman.pl
---------------
send_gearman.pl is a perl implementation of the send_gearman tool. You
can use it to compile a windows binary and use that to send in results
from windows platforms.
